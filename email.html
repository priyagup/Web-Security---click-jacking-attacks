	<p>Dear Students,</p>
	<p>Due to a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack this afternoon, University websites, <a href="Google.html">Gmail</a>, and other systems were down from<br/>approximately 2 to 3:30 pm.</p>
	
	<p>As soon as the event was detected, ITS took immediate steps to stop the attack and restore services. We realize some students were<br/>unable to register for spring 		semester classes during this time. All systems are restored and functioning smoothly now; we sincerely<br/>apologize for any issues this may have caused.</p>

	<p>For any further questions, please contact the IT Service Desk at 409-880-2222 or  <a href="https://www.lamar.edu/it-services-and-support/index.html">lamar.edu/students/it-services-and-support</a> </p>

	<p>Thank you,</p>
	Shelly
